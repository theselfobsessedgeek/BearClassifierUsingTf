# BearClassifierUsingTf

This project takes up the problem statemet to identify that the presented image to the model is either a real bear (i.e. Grizzly or Black) or it is a teddy bear.
We would be using tendsorflow library to make a Convolutional Neural Network to acomplish our purposes later we would also return a plot of the confusion matrix for the same.
